Welcome!

Here, we want to learn how to apply advanced techniques and tools for automated software development to create powerful and reliable software products. 
To focus on those, we will keep the project base, a basic to-do-list, very simple and try to integrate the following topics to our project:

- Maven, our build tool 
- Junit testing to constantly prove software quality
- Integration of a CI-pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Test coverage using JaCoCo
- Test doubles with Mockito
- static code analysis with ErrorProne

Enjoy the stay! :)
